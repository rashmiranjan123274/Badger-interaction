# Features  of Badger Defi 
# Yield Farming:
New DeFi startups are constantly launching. Many of them provide tokens as a reward for depositing assets into their protocols, known as "yield farming."
# Lending:
Like traditional finance, you can earn interest by supplying assets to be lent. These loans are typically secured by an amount larger than the loan and will be automatically paid back if the collateral value drops, making them extremely safe for the lender.
# Providing Liquidity:
You can supply assets to markets that let users swap between tokens. In exchange, users receive a portion of the trading fees.

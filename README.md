Like traditional finance, you can earn interest by supplying assets to be lent. These loans are typically secured by an amount larger than the loan and will be automatically paid back if the collateral value drops, making them extremely safe for the lender.

You can supply assets to markets that let users swap between tokens. In exchange, users receive a portion of the trading fees.
